# apas_75
_... connecting Starships!_

## About
The goal is to have a small program which updates the [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
configuration after each command, based on different theme config files that override / 
extend the main configuration.  
Similar the config `ZSH_THEME="random"` of [_Oh My Zsh_](https://ohmyz.sh/).

## Status

## What does _APAS-75_ mean?
The [APAS-75](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgynous_Peripheral_Attach_System#APAS-75)
is a spacecraft docking mechanism, developed by soviet and american engineers. It was 
built to connect an Apollo and a Soyuz spacecraft during the _Apolloâ€“Soyuz Test Project_.  
By "adapting" multiple _Starship_ theme files, you could say that this project aims for
something similar.
